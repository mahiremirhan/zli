## Introduction

**zli** is designed to simplify the process of building command-line applications. Zig is a low-level programming language that emphasizes performance and safety. By leveraging Zig's strengths, **zli** allows developers to focus on functionality without worrying about the underlying complexities.

## Features

- **Fast Performance**: Built on Zig's efficient compilation and execution model.
- **Ergonomic Design**: Intuitive API that makes it easy to create and manage commands.
- **Modular Architecture**: Easily extend functionality with custom modules.
- **Rich Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples to help you get started.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Installation

To get started with **zli**, you need to install the framework. Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/mahiremirhan/zli/releases) section to download the latest version. Follow the instructions to install and execute the framework.

## Getting Started

After installing **zli**, you can create a new CLI application. Hereâ€™s how:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.
3. Run the following command to create a new project:

   ```bash
   zli create my-cli-app
   ```

4. Navigate into your new project directory:

   ```bash
   cd my-cli-app
   ```

5. Open the main source file in your favorite text editor.

## Usage

Creating commands in **zli** is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to define a command:

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const zli = @import("zli");

pub fn main() !void {
    const app = zli.Application.init("my-cli-app", "1.0.0");

    app.command("greet", "Greet the user", greet);

    try app.run();
}

fn greet(args: *zli.CommandArgs) !void {
    const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();
    try stdout.print("Hello, {}!\n", .{args.get("name")});
}
```

### Running Your Application

Once you have defined your commands, you can run your application from the terminal:

```bash
./my-cli-app greet --name="World"
```

This will output:

```
Hello, World!
```
